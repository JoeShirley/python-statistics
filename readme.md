This is a simple python script for basic work with quantitive data.
Simply run the script through the command line or terminal and follow all of the prompts.
Currently the script does not do more than a graphing calculator but I will be adding more complex functions as time goes on

You will need python 2.7 to run this script.
You can find information and download links for python at www.python.org
